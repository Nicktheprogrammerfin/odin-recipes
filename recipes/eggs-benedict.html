            <li>Stir it well and repeat this process, slowly adding one spoonful of hot butter to the egg mixture <em>(We do this to avoid curdling the eggs)</em>.</li>
            <li>Finally, add the mixture back to the saucepan and cook it for a few more seconds.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Now The Poached Egg</h5>

            <li>Bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer.</li>
            <li>Add a little splash of vinegar to the water <em>(to help the egg white stay together)</em>.</li>
            <li>Crack one egg into a small cup, or measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Lower the egg into the simmer water, gently easing it out of the cup.</li>
            <li>Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft you like youir egg yolk.</li>
            <li>Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Almost There!</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm The Canadian Bacon.</li>
            <li>Toast The English Muffin.</li>
            <li>Place the Canadian Bacon on top of half of a toasted English Muffin</li>
            <li>Place one poached egg on top of the Canadian bacon, and then smother with Hollandaise Sauce.</li>
